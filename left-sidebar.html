											<h2>THE BEST VET CLINIC IN THE UK</h2>
											<p></p>
										</header>
										<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/logo.png" alt="" /></a>
										<p>The PAWVET Clinic is a modern and well-equipped, purpose built veterinary surgery. The main vet Margit has over 10 years experience and she is a dedicated and caring professional. She is accompanied by a qualified nurse, trainee care assistants and experienced receptionists. Meet our vets and nurses.
At the PAWVET we value preventative healthcare for the long-term wellness of your pet. We therefore like to see you when your pet is healthy to ensure it stays healthy and happy as possible as it moves through its stages of life. We have a VIP Healthcare Plan that spreads the cost of your pet’s routine health care and also ensure the optimal prevention of illness</p>
										<p>Our modern approach to vet care is reflected in our well-equipped surgery, providing the full range of services from vaccines and preventative treatments to surgical and hospitalisation facilities.
The surgery has been accredited by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons as a Tier 2 practice. In order to become accredited, the surgery has volunteered to undergo a rigorous inspection every four years and must achieve a minimum of standards including hygiene, staff training, equipment and patient care. This means high standards of care for your pets and peace of mind for pet owners. The surgery is also a training practice for veterinary nurses.</p>
										<p>We also have an online shop which offers a convenient way for you to buy your pet's food, health care products and accessories, and allows us to stock the full range of most preferred pet foods. We currently offer 10% off all items bought through the online shop.</p>
